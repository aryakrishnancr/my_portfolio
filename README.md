## 🎯 Key Projects

### 🔍 Data Validation Tools

**Swift DVT**  
Event-driven data validation tool to verify parity between Cornerstone (Hive) and Lumi (BigQuery) with summary stats, row/column comparisons, scheduling, email alerts, and multi-environment support.

**Hash DVT**  
High-speed parity checks using hashing to validate data integrity across on-prem and GCP with minimal overhead.

**BQ-to-BQ DVT**  
BigQuery-native validator for cross-dataset/table comparisons enabling robust post-migration and intra-cloud validations.

**Lumi Ascend**  
Automated validation tool that periodically polls UDM Audit Table to identify new ingestions and compares data between direct source and hydration tables. Generates ingestion summary and detailed discrepancy reports with configurable auto-validation thresholds, plus manual trigger capability for re-runs and backfills.

### 🚀 Data Optimization & Acceleration

**Lumi First**  
Data readiness and acceleration toolkit to enable faster BigQuery adoption for analytics teams.

**BQ Clustering & Partitioning Analyzer**  
Analyzer recommending optimal partitioning and clustering strategies to improve BigQuery performance and cost.
